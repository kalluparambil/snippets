Visit https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/1704/using-merge-in-sql-server-to-insert-update-and-delete-at-the-same-time/ to see examples.

My examples:
	WITH DISTINCT_SRC AS
	(SELECT DISTINCT
	     [col1]
				...
	    ,[col10]
	FROM <TABLE>
  WHERE 1=1
  --Any constraits
	)
	MERGE <Dest_Table> AS DEST
	USING DISTINCT_SRC AS SRC
	--Merged to be made based on these keys
	ON (DEST.<Key1> = SRC.<Key1> AND DEST.<Key2> = SRC.<Key2>)
	WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET
    THEN
    INSERT
	  (
	     [col1]
				...
	    ,[col10]
	  )
    VALUES
    (
	     [col1]
				...
	    ,[col10]

    )
WHEN MATCHED
    THEN UPDATE
    SET
       DEST.<Col1>           = SRC.<Col1>
				...
       DEST.<Col1>           = SRC.<Col1>
	OUTPUT $action
	    , INSERTED.<KEY1> AS INS_<KEY1>
	 INTO #TMP_<Table1>
	;
